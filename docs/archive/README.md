# Archived Planning Documents

These documents were used during the planning phase but have been superseded by the consolidated extraction plan.

**⚠️ DO NOT USE THESE FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

**Canonical Reference:** `/EXTRACTION-PLAN.md` (repository root)

## Archived Files

- `oauth-extraction-review.md` - Initial review with 18 critical issues (Oct 5, 2025)
- `oauth-mcp-proxy-extraction-plan.md` - Original extraction plan (Oct 5, 2025)
- `EXTRACTION-STRATEGY-ANALYSIS.md` - Strategy analysis comparing 3 approaches (Oct 17, 2025)

## Why Archived?

1. **Contradiction:** These documents recommended "Fix then Extract" strategy, which was later changed to "Extract then Fix"
2. **Documentation Drift:** Multiple sources of truth caused confusion
3. **Gemini 2.5 Pro Review:** Recommended consolidating into single canonical document

## Historical Value

These documents contain valuable analysis and should be preserved for reference:
- Detailed breakdown of 18 critical issues
- Security analysis and attack scenarios
- Timeline estimates and risk assessment
- Comparison of extraction strategies
